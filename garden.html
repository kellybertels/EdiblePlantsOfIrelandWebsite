<h2> Growing Wild Garlic</h2>
<p><i>Allium ursinum</i></p>
<p>You can grow wild garlic in a small patch in a shady corner.</p>
<p>Almost all parts of wild garlic are usable, including the leaves, stems and flowers.</p>
<p>Wild garlic can be raised from seed or, more easily, grown from bulbs. The bulbs do not store like those of cultivated garlic, they dry out and die quite quickly if they are not stored moist. They transplant very well ‘in the green’ (while the bulbs are growing), which also avoids the problem of forgetting where you have planted the bulbs! </p>

<p>Wild Garlic are an easy plant to grow, flourishing in the parts of the garden that most other plants avoid. They are a plant of deep woodland, so they like plenty of shade and a moist, humus-rich soil. Once you have got them established they will generally self-seed (to the point of nuisance if they weren’t so edible). Their habit of dying down in the summer makes them easy to manage as you can choose this time to top-dress them, mulch them or hoe over the top of the bulbs.</p>

<p>Wild Garlic are capable of growing through quite a thick mulch: their leaves form green spikes that punch up through mulch before unfurling.</p>
