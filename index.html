</figure>

<p>You can Find Wild garlic across Ireland, It's a common plant and it thrives in mixed woodlands and other damp, shady places like country lanes and near streams. </p>

<p>The leaves of the Wild Garlic are edible; they can be used as salad, herb, boiled as a vegetable, in soup, or as an ingredient for a sauce that may be a substitute for pesto in lieu of basil. The stems are preserved by salting and eaten as a salad in Russia. </p>

<h3> How to pick</h3>

<figure class="img_rect" >
<img src="images/wildgarlic1.jpg"  class="ui fluid rounded image"  alt="Wild Garlic">
<figcaption>Wild Garlic Leaves</figcaption>
</figure>




<p>Do not dig up the bulbs and never strip a plant of all its leaves or remove all the flowers or plants in a small area. Pick mid-sized to larger leaves and flower heads that have blossomed. Baskets are ideal for gathering (particularly for the flowers) but if you plan to preserve the leaves choose roomy plastic bags. Pack loosely and do not press down or you may bruise the tender leaves and flowers.</p>

<h3 >How to eat it safely</h3>
<p>
Shake flower to remove insects and then wash flowers and leaves in cold water and spread out on a clean cloth; pat with a cloth or kitchen paper to remove moisture.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>
In early Celtic times annual garlic feasts had to be provided by the lower orders to their clan chiefs and chiefs to their kings. Garlic was widely used as an herb with fish and to flavour soups, stews, potato dishes and in salads. In rural areas, particularly in northern counties, the traditional uses continue.</p>
