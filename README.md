# EdiblePlantsOfIrelandWebsite
 This is a second semester college project, for Web App Development. 
 
 I decided to create and application about edible plants of Ireland. 
 
 #Features  
 
 This Webpage contain Javascript animations: at the "recipes page" the user can move the ingredients that he has, as well fade out the steps that were took to compleete the recipe, the about page I explain the external plugins that I used to include design movement to the page, as a carrouseel plugin, and a flip cart plug in that is activated when you mouse over at my profile picture in the about page. 
 
 
Programming languages used here were HTML, CSS, Javascript and Handlebars. 


#Knowing bugs  
When you flip the card, the seed image is not covering totally the image behind as it should. 

#Aditional information  
My main focus here was to get a clean looking confortable layout, for the page picking the colours that will match with the theme of the website. old drawmings of herbs and plants were used as a process of inspiration for this project.
